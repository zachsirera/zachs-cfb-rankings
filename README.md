# Zach's CFB Rankings #

The poll can be accessed publically [here](https://zachs-cfb-rankings.herokuapp.com/)

### Methodology ### 

This is a computer based poll that assigns points to teams based only on the score outcome of their games and then weighs those games by the perceived strength of their opponent. A team's rank is then determined by summing up the points they have earned throughout the season and comparing to the rest of the NCAA D1 FBS.

### Build Info ###

This poll is built with Flask, Python, SQL, and Bootstrap.

All NCAA FBS game data is scraped from the [Massey Composite](https://www.masseyratings.com/scores.php?s=300937&sub=11604&all=1)
